// comments below by Michael (this can be deleted if it doesn't work out for whoever is doing the Institution Dashbood
// InstitutionDash re-exports the admin dashboard component so routes that
// reference `InstitutionDash` (by filename) will render the same admin UI.
// This keeps the filename/route consistent while avoiding duplicated code.
